# COP Examples

## Conventions to document

- Process name displayed as button on COP UI
- Process documentation (or element documentation?) displayed as procedure description (text left of button) 
- Id = LeadingCaps
- Name = Sentence case
- Process Id (used in URL) = process-id
- Events = Predicate (e.g. went back) 
- Avoid Join gateways (confusing)
- Pass all data to called processes for API stability


## Investigate

- Camunda doesn't allow data store (only data store ref)???
